## PROJECT NAME: CAESAR CIPHER PROJECT

## AUTHOR: William Java

## DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT

Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".

## Encoding_Class Function

Enter a message to encode (only alphabets and no space)
Enter a key [1-25]

## Decoding_Class Function

Enter file with correct format and message
Enter key shift [1-25]
